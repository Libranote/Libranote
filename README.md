# Libranote

Libre software to manage different aspects of school life

For now, it only displays a timetable of the week. Test data are in French, because Libranote has been designed for the French system.

We use Preact for the web client, and JSON-server as a temporary back-end.

To run it, just do:

```
npm i

npm run api

# In another terminal
npm run dev
```

And go on [0.0.0.0:8080](http://0.0.0.0:8080).
